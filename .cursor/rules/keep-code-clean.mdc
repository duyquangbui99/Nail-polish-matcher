As an intern, I want to maintain a clean and readable codebase. Please follow these rules when generating code:

Do not refactor or rewrite existing code unless absolutely necessary.

Only add what is required to make the feature or fix work.

Keep solutions simple, efficient, and beginner-friendly â€” no overengineering.

Avoid introducing new libraries or patterns unless I ask for them.

Follow the current code style and structure.

If you're unsure, ask before making large changes.
